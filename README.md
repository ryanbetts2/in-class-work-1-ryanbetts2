# Ryan's Big Project

## 3 Things about me
1. Work at a golf course
2. Coach a youth football team
3. Big St.louis Blues fan

## Why I'm in this class
- I'm in this class because it's required for my degree. I have one more semester then I should be done. I look forward to leaving the golf course business and moving over to IT.
